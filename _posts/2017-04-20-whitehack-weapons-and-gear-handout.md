[Whitehack](https://whitehackrpg.wordpress.com/) is a game I have enjoyed running this past year. There is lots to love but the fast, flexible and creative character creation is probably my favourite part.

When creating new characters, rolling for gold and shopping for appropriate weapons and gear is something I leave to my players. To make it easy I've created a double-sided handout with all the gear/weapons from the book plus the rules around burden and class specific weapons/armour exceptions. 

I've been using the weapons side in my GM screen as reference while running games as well.
