## City
The city of Oturak is a merchant town in the base of a great desert canyon. The entire city is built within a fissure on the east side of the canyon. Rock cliffs reach hundreds of feet up on  two sides and a man made wall guards from windstorms and invaders in the canyon. The population fluctuates with trade, with a maximum of 2,500. For many years, caravans from the realm to the north have brought fine textiles to trade for spices from the realm to the south. As the lone place of refuge along the arid road, Oturak is the natural place for merchants to rest and to trade their goods. Many people have become rich within its red walls.

## Population
Governor Naazil has earned respect by keeping the peace in Oturak with the help of the town guard. Naazil lives in the far east corner and the guard barracks surround his mansion. People become poorer as you move away from Naazil’s mansion and toward the wall. The wealthy merchants live in large stone manors and the poorest people, who work as laborers, live in tents or wooden shacks along the wall.

## Cult
In the past few years, a fertility cult has grown in the west of the city. They are led by an old summoner called ‘The Oracle’ by his followers and they seek to bring glory to the ‘Divine Mother.’ To reach this end, the cult is planning a ritual to cleanse the desert of non-believers (see below). Cultists shave their bodies and wear short cloth pants; high ranking members have a tattooed line starting from their belly button. The town guard treats cultists with disregard.
