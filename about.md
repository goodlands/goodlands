_Good Lands_ is a collaboration between Evan Gillespie and Colin Sproule. This site is a place for Tabletop RPG stuff we create.

* Evan really likes D&D 5th Edition
* Colin really likes Indie and OSR games

We are friends and live in Calgary, Canada. We ride our bicycles all year, even in the winter.
